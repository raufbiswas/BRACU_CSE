At first create a txt file and the copy it's directory. If you keep your code and txt in the same folder then you can use file name instead of folder directory.

To access,
file1 = open("directory/file_name", "access_mode")

access mode --> r, w, a

read, write, append

To read,
file1 = open("directory/file_name", "r")

.read() --> read the whole file

.readline() --> read the file line by line

.readlines() --> read the whole file line by line and it add line breaks with every line of code.

file1.close() --> close the file

OR

with open("input.txt", "r") as file1:

To write,
file2 = open("directory/file_name", "w")

file2.write() 
file2.close

file2.write() 
file2.close

- it will overwrite data in the existing file.

file2 = open("directory/file_name", "a")

file2.write() 
file2.close

file2.write() 
file2.close

- it will append data in the existing file.

Suppose: 
input.txt = 
First Line
Second Line
Third Line

Code:
file1 = open("input.txt", 'r')
print(file1.readline())
file1.close()

Output:
First Line

Code:
with open("input.txt", "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read())

Output:
First Line
Second Line
Third Line

Code:
file1 = open("input.txt", 'r')
print(file1.readlines())
file1.close()

Output:
First Line\n, Second Lin\n, Third Line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code:
file2 = open("output.txt", "w") --> it will create a output.txt file.

file2.write("Hello\nCSE221 SEC20\nSpring24")
file2.close()

Output:
Hello
CSE221 SEC20
Spring24

Code:
file2 = open("output.txt", "a")

file2.write("\nGoru")
file2.close()

Output:
Hello
CSE221 SEC20
Spring24
Goru

Code:
file2 = open("output.txt", "w")

file2.write("Chagol")
file2.close()

Output:
Chagol
